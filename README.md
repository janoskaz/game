game
====

for learning purposes - simple rpg game with ascii graphics

objects are defined as C# objects, more complicated interaction is governed by lua scripts

**TODO**

+ manage several dungeons - loading and saving data, transfer of configuration

+ how to store configuration of a player - perhaps a table in lua, which is read by C# and stored?

+ improve listing through commands

+ Door - shouldn't be the object simplified? no key, instead having lua script for every door?
